But freelancers who fail to negotiate well can miss potential revenue, delay the growth of their project portfolio, and lose future opportunities that might otherwise come in through with the referrals that come from successful relationships with clients. Three specific areas often trip up freelancers in their work with clients: focusing on the business aspect of the relationship to the detriment of building a personal rapport; attempting to differentiate themselves from their competitors with price discounting; and wasting their negotiation time on the wrong clients. Avoiding each will allow you to build better relationships with the clients who matter most–and build a robust pipeline of rewarding work.close\n\n\nDavid Rowland/Getty Images\nToday, 1 in 3 working Americans are freelancing. That’s about 57 million workers from a force of 160 million, up 4 million (13%) since 2014.\n\nFreelancers are experts in their own fields, but they are also business managers: branding themselves, marketing their services, managing finances—and negotiating deals with potential clients. Those conversations can be challenging for independent contractors. But freelancers who fail to negotiate well can miss potential revenue, delay the growth of their project portfolio, and lose future opportunities that might otherwise come in through with the referrals that come from successful relationships with clients.\n\nIn my 25 years of advising corporations and independent contractors on how to negotiate, I’ve found that three specific areas often trip up freelancers in their work with clients. First, they focus on the business aspect of the relationship to the detriment of building a personal rapport; second, they attempt to differentiate themselves from their competitors with price discounting, and third, they waste their negotiation time on the wrong clients. Let’s look at each of these.\n\nMake it personal\nRelationships and authentic connections drive business. People do business with people they know; familiarity is the basis for trust at a chemical, physiological level in the brain.\n\nThis principle is particularly important for freelancers, for whom trust and confidence are table stakes. In a large corporate negotiation, the desire to let a relationship drive a deal might be tempered by the needs of the parties’ bosses or their shareholders. But if you’re a freelancer, you stand on your own. A client’s relationship with you is your business. From initial discussions with a possible client to the moment you seal a deal with them, the success of the negotiation hinges on their decision to invest in and engage with you.\n\nAs a freelancer, then, when you enter into a negotiation, build the relationship as the reflection of your own brand and values. Do this by telling your own story, describing your unique qualifications and abilities, and finding common ground to build connections.\n\nHere’s a simple formula for your narrative:\n\nWhat do you believe? Begin with an idea that stems from your passions and fuels your approach. For example, a public relations freelancer could begin by saying, “To me, PR is about understanding an audience and giving them a good story.”\nWhat led you to this? Then, help your counterpart understand how you got to this point and why you are qualified to help them: “When I studied investigative journalism at Penn State, I first began honing my interviewing skills with local news outlets and student groups on campus. And for the last decade of my professional career, I have worked with industry leaders and have worked with several Fortune 500 companies, like Verizon Communications and Bank of America.\nHow does it drive what you do today? Finally, connect it back to them, rather than ending on something about yourself. “The story you have is something people need to hear, and I can see it making an impact in a publication like Time.”\nYou can keep much of this material consistent no matter which client you’re pitching, especially the initial belief statement. But your story should never be fully canned. Weave in tidbits related to the specific project you’re pitching, the organization the project is for, or the person with whom you’re negotiating. This is your opportunity to establish common ground.\n\nTo identify those tidbits, take note of details in your small talk and begin looking for links between your world and theirs. Use these links to allow the conversation to meander organically. You both love rescue dogs? Or the same baseball team? These short digressions can build a rapport that leads to deeper substance: the person’s struggles, stressors, and aspirations. Look for your opportunities to say, “We are cut from the same cloth; your goals are my goals. We pursue the same dream.”\n\nResist the temptation to discount\nBuilding a relationship doesn’t guarantee a win: the terms of the deal still matter.\n\nWhen pursuing a partnership, big corporations can undercut competitors with steep discounts; because of their size they can absorb and recoup the loss over time. Many freelancers also offer discounts to win work but doing so is less sustainable.\n\nLet’s say you’ve determined that $50/hour is your standard rate. To attract clients or win a project you feel passionate about, you may consider dropping that to $40 or even lower. But that sends a message that your work is worth less. And especially in online freelancer forums like Upwork where potential clients can see your previous rates, it becomes difficult (if not impossible) to later increase your rates to their true value –even as you gain experience.\n\nInstead, I encourage freelancers I work with to offer a specific fixed fee for each project. This allows you to define the unique scope and deliverables for a particular project and client while maintaining your hourly rate. It also positions you well for future negotiations with a similar scope.\n\nClients tend to like fixed-rate projects, too, because of the clear expectations established for a price and scope of work. They are guaranteed a set of deliverables with no risk of overages if you end up working more hours than you anticipated. This is especially helpful if a client has reservations or concerns about the rounds of revisions needed to produce a polished final product. (Of course it also means that you bear the risk of any time overages.)\n\nOne final way to avoid lowering your price is to offer more at your standard rate. This might sound like a raw deal for you, but it can be as simple as finding other ways to charge for work you are already doing. For example, if your typical process involves secondary research, you can easily compile your sources into a dossier to provide to the client as a value-add. You maintain your premium pricing; they get more for their money.\n\nThere are some situations in which you may want or need to offer a discount, whether or not you offer a fixed rate. But to keep these situations to a minimum and to keep them consistent, set your criteria in advance. And limit the discounts to those that have a built-in reason for you to restore your established rate for other projects. Common discounts are based on referrals (if your client brings you a new opportunity, they get a discount), location or proximity (local clients don’t require you to spend on travel), or simply first-timer discounts to mark a new relationship.\n\nDon’t spend time negotiating with the wrong partners\nIt can be tempting to treat every potential client like royalty during the relationship-building and negotiation process. But this can be costly. Many freelancers we work with express frustration at how much time they spend on potential clients only to lose them in the end.\n\nAs you begin courting a new potential client, consider two key criteria to determine how much effort to devote to them: pay and value. Pay is simply the amount of money you stand to receive if the contract goes through. The greater the likely pay, the more time and energy you can justify spending on the negotiation. Value is more nebulous: it can refer to how much your client acknowledges your work, or how much personal passion you have for the project.\n\nThese two factors create a grid:\n\n\n\nObviously those clients in the top right quadrant—loyal customers who value your work and pay you well for it—are your first priority. Acknowledge and appreciate them, respond in a timely manner. Don’t take them for granted. Likewise, the only reason to keep clients in the bottom-left quadrant on your radar is if you have reason to believe they’ll soon move elsewhere on your grid: if you’re going to start offering a service they’re interested in, for example.\n\nThe other two quadrants are more interesting. In the bottom-right quadrant, there’s a productive contract in the offing but the relationship is off. Perhaps your work styles conflict or you have failed to establish a personal relationship. Potential clients often enter this quadrant when their negotiator is given instructions that they personally may not agree with, or when they fundamentally disagree with their company’s leadership. You should treat these negotiations with a grain of salt—they’re more likely to disappear.\n\nThe top-left quadrant is the most dangerous. Here there’s a mismatch between the freelancer’s offerings and the client’s needs, despite a potentially fruitful relationship. The freelancer is often trapped currying favor and doing odd tasks for little or no pay, on the tenuous promise that paying work will eventually come. The freelancer justifies it because the personal relationship feels valuable; their counterpart’s words can be affirming. But it is critical to stay vigilant for these toxic negotiations, keep them at a distance, and if necessary, shift them to the bottom-left quadrant until they are able to pay for your work.\n\nTo this exercise add questions like whether there is a firm budget set aside for the work, how many stakeholders are involved, and who ultimately makes the decisions. Ultimately what matters is making informed decisions about where to spend your time.\n\nBy building relationships, maintaining your rates, and allocating your negotiating effort appropriately, you can find the autonomy you seek as a freelancer while building a pipeline of rewarding work."

        "text": "Scope creep – the horrifyingly common tendency for projects to expand past their initial bounds. How to avoid scope creep is the question brewing at the back of every freelancer’s mind while preparing a proposal template, or when first submitting a scope of work template and discussing project details with a new client or agency.\n\nBut get this:\n\nWhether you like it or not, the truth is, scope creep happens naturally, no matter how well you manage your freelance projects.\n\nThe trick is understanding what scope creep really is, together with the strategies and solutions for working around this tendency in any professional situation. This not only increases your chances of delivering your professional project in the same budget and time frame you agreed on but will help you feel more confident in your career.\n\nSound awesome?\n\nIn this article, we’ll outline why scope creep happens in the first place and how you can tackle the common issue, professionally and smoothly like the prepared and confident freelancer you are.\n\nhow-to-avoid-scope-creep-projects\nWhat is scope creep?\nFirst off, what is scope creep?\n\nAs we briefly mentioned, scope creep refers to changes in a project’s professional scope, at any point after the project commences.\n\nThe changes in scope could refer to:\n\nAdditions in the project’s requirements\nA sudden change in client needs\nAdditional features to a product\nWhile this sounds super annoying as a freelancer, especially when the client is requesting the same payout, scope creep isn’t all that bad.\n\nHonestly.\n\nChange is inevitable. However, like anything else, it’s all a matter of how you approach the situation that makes the difference.\n\nLooking for hacks to get you started on properly preparing for your clients? Sign up for a free trial of Bonsai to get the inside scoop - tons of features to protect you against scope creep, such as bullet-proof freelance contract templates, time-tracking per task, and more.\n\nhow-to-avoid-scope-creep-freelancer\nWhat are the causes of scope creep?\nThe majority of scope creep situations arise from clients who don’t know how to properly define their requirements. However, depending on the project, there can be a number of ways scope creep ‘creeps’ up.\n\nHere are some primary causes of scope creep:\n\n1. Poor requirements analysis\n‍When your client doesn’t know the full scope to start with and/or doesn’t spend enough time gathering appropriate documents and research for you.\n\n2. Not including users early enough\n‍Assuming you know what your users need or want. Not including users in the analysis and building stages can lead to issues and/or scope creep.\n\n3. Underestimating the project’s complexity\nIf your client is new to the industry, they may guess through projects as they don’t know what to expect and plan for.\n\n4. Gold plating\nThis is a common term used for exceeding a project’s scope due to the belief that these changes will increase the value.\n\nUnderstanding the causes of scope creep is your first step towards mastering how to safely avoid scope creep in the first place.\n\nTry Bonsai for Free\n7 tactics for mastering how you avoid scope creep\nNow that you understand the full scope of scope creep, it’s time for preparation.\n\nHere’s the thing:\n\nEvery project is different because every freelance client is different (in one way or another).\n\nWhile some of these tactics may work well for one client, they could be totally useless for the next. The key here is to understand all the ways on how to avoid scope creep so that you’re fully prepared for any situation this freelancing ride throws your way.\n\nNot only that, but these tactics are great tools to have for building confidence and professionalism as well.\n\nBonuses all around.\n\n1. Keep note of the requirements\nFirst thing’s fist: be organized.\n\nBeing organized by documenting each clients’ requirements not only makes you feel great, but it is the single most important step to avoiding scope creep.\n\nTalk to everyone involved and figure out exactly what they want from the project, then write it all down in an organized document or online tool. This process, for some professional services, is known as creating an engagement letter. Also, manage potential conflicts and prioritize requirements (as much as possible).\n\nAfter your document is completed, add your client and everyone else involved in the project to your online document for easy, group access.\n\nYou can also add this document to a larger project plan if you have one in motion, or consider the help of a project management tool for freelancers to keep everything nicely sorted.\n\n2. Change control processes: set-up\nWhile a requirements document is a great starting point, chances are, someone will want to tweak something at some point. This reality requires a change control process.\n\nThankfully, this process is straightforward.\n\nSo, let’s say your client or a stakeholder suggests a change. If the change is approved, then incorporate it into your group-shared project plan.\n\nIf the project management software you’re using supports a change management function, then simply use that. The trick here is figuring out who is going to review and approve any changes.\n\nEmpower a finite amount of people to request scope changes and an even smaller number to grant these wishes. Describe and document the process for receiving additional freelance invoice payments for any scope changes made after a certain period of time.\n\nIf they agree, follow our client billing guide to seal the deal.\n\n3. Make a coherent project schedule\nAfter your document requirements are added to your project plan, you can then create a project schedule.\n\nBy using your requirements document, create a task list that shows:\n\nWhat your project will deliver.\nHow the requirements will be achieved.\nWhen approximately they should be completed by. You can use Bonsai's time tracker to help you make these estimates.\nThis list should be written in the form of activities and tasks.\n\nSince we now know that changes are inevitable, put some time aside for contingency. This allows for changes to be accepted in a constructive way since it’s planned and discussed up front.\n\nThere are tons of different project management tools you can use to jumpstart this scheduling process.\n\n4. Involve the project team\nEncourage all users and partners to be a part of the requirements and building phase. Include their ideas and suggestions into the product.\n\nWhile this happens, it’s also smart to document how everyone interacts with the initial plan.\n\nBefore the execution phase commences, make sure everyone agrees on the requirements and overall design or plan.\n\nIt’s also important to remind users or partners of the change rules: that change suggestions don’t just happen by someone liking the idea. The change must be approved by the group or designated individual(s).\n\nhow-to-avoid-scope-creep-gold-plating\n5. Prepare for gold plating\nAs we mentioned in an earlier section, gold plating is a real and daunting cause of scope creep.\n\nThis is a tendency created by the client or agency to over-delivery the scope and create additional features, thinking it will add value to the project.\n\nWhile they usually have the project’s best interest at heart, their tunnel-vision usually doesn’t account for the freelancer’s time or the project’s structure.\n\nPrepare for gold plating by including information in the project plan about additional payment for certain types of add-on features.\n\n6. Learn when to say “no”\nWhen you’re learning how to avoid scope creep, sometimes all it takes is the magic word.\n\nYou have to come to the realization that there will be unreasonable requests for scope changes.\n\nWhile you’re likely a rockstar freelancer, you’re only human.\n\nUnderstand that not all scope changes are made equal. Any scope changes to vital path elements (areas of the project that hold up other work if not completed on time) should be allowed only sparingly…\n\nAnd evaluated carefully.\n\n7. Alternatives to saying no\nIf you’re not comfortable saying no… or if you’ve already said no a few times, there’s a few Plan Bs you can refer to:\n\nCommunicate with your client that if something is added into the scope, something must come out (from their pockets).\nPrice the scope creep. How much will the changes or additional features cost? Telling them the numbers upfront may discourage any more requests from arising.\nYou can also charge late fees to your client. This can be intimidating, but there are tons of resources to guide you, making the process as smooth as can be.\nhow-to-avoid-scope-creep-agreement\nBonuses to being creeped-on\nWhile this may sound intimidating, once you nail down your own process and really understand what scope creep is and how you can avoid it, it will just become a part of your freelancing regime.\n\nAnd guess what?\n\nScope creep can actually be a positive thing when working with external clients.\n\nIf you stay organized and use a professionally written freelance contract that includes prices of additional features, you could create new revenue for yourself. Worrying about how to avoid scope creep becomes a thing of the past.\n\nAs soon as the external client requests a listed feature, all you need to do is calculate the hours of additional work, have the client sign-off, and wham.\n\nFreelance scope creep... reversed."
